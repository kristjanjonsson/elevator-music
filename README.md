To get up and running run `make bootstrap-mac`or `make bootstrap-raspberry`
depending on which you are running. For it to work you'll need homebrew for mac
and the latest python 2 with pip in both cases.

Then to run the app make sure the virtual environment is activated `. venv/bin/activate` and run
`python app.py`.
